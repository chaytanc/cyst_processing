This script will take in any number of arguments, with at least two. The first is the location on the Hyak where
you want to transfer the files. The second, and potentially third, fourth, etc... arguments are the paths (relative to
your working directory) to the models you would like to transfer to that location on the Hyak. Technically, despite
being named transfer_models.py, you can transfer any type of file to any location on the Hyak. You
could also specify a directory instead of a file. You will need to separately ssh for each different file to transfer it.
