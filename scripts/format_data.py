It will typically be named out_{day}.csv        as processed by consolidate_csvs.py.    {output path} is the path to the file name of the formatted excel file. For example,         to put it in the current directory and name the file my_file.xlsx, pass the argument "./my_file.xlsx".        More likely, the path will contain something about the /out folder.    PRECONDITIONS:    Assumes that row entries in the input csv are unique. There should be     no duplicate treatments on the same day.    Requires pip install openpyxl to write to excel filesEFFECTS:    Formats the data from all the processed csv files is filtered for     just the entries detecting "cystanoids" and not other labels    like background. Then the area and intensity are found for OUTPUT:    modified_{input csv}.csv is a more readable and organized verison    of the input csv.'''#col_headers = ["Treatment", "Well", "Day", "Area", "Diameter", "Mean Intensity"]#louisa_col_headers = ["Treatment", "Concentration", "ID", "Day", "Area", "Intensity"]#whose_data = "LOUISA"WHOSE_DATA = "RAMILA"# old_headers =filename	object_id	timestep	labelimage_oid	User Label	Predicted Class	Probability of bkgrd# Probability of cystanoid	Minimum intensity_0	Minimum intensity_1	Minimum intensity_2	Maximum intensity_0	Maximum# intensity_1	Maximum intensity_2	Size in pixels	Radii of the object_0	Radii of the object_1	Variance of# Intensity_0	Variance of Intensity_1	Variance of Intensity_2	Mean Intensity_0	Mean Intensity_1	Mean# Intensity_2	Diameter	Bounding Box Minimum_0	Bounding Box Minimum_1	Bounding Box Maximum_0	Bounding Box# Maximum_1	Center of the object_0	Center of the object_1# new old headers same as before but with filename day... instead of filename...# Default is Ramila formattingdef format_data(df, output_path):    # get cystanoid prediction rows    print(output_path, ": ", df)    cystanoid_rows = df.loc[df["Predicted Class"] == "cystanoid"].reset_index()    filename_df = cystanoid_rows.loc[:, "filename"]    #print("filename_df : ", filename_df)    with_file_cols_df = _parse_filenames(filename_df)    #print("with file info df: ", with_file_cols_df)    # add_relevant_info(with_file_cols_df, cystanoid_rows)    add_relevant_info_multi(with_file_cols_df, cystanoid_rows)    new_df = _calculate_fold_change(with_file_cols_df)    #XXX working here to add csv flag so that we can more easily compare output in tests    if "csv" in output_path:        new_df.to_csv(output_path)    else:        new_df.to_excel(output_path)    print("Success!
